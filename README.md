# Pentest Writeups
This repository contains PDFs of my penetration test reports against virtual machines on hackthebox.eu. All content (text, screenshots, etc.) were created by myself on my machine. All actions performed were legal and within the rules and guidelines of hackthebox. The exploits used are obtained from public sites, and my use of them is limited soley to the virtual machine being attacked. These reports are intended to emulate the results of a real-life penetration test, but against a virtual system.
